This is a plugin for [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) that adds the ability to generate getters, 
setters, and deleters for your properties automatically. Since this is a new release, please consider opening
a pull request or opening an issue if you find any problems.

## Generating the Properties
You can generate getters and setters by:

1. Pressing `alt + insert`  (or right click then click generate)
2. A popup titled *"Generate"* will open
3. Choose the bottom option *"Getters and Setters"*


## Editting the Generated Format
Don't like the default format? You can edit the [live code template](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-live-templates.html) 
to customize the format to your choosing. See [#1](https://github.com/CJCrafter/PythonGettersAndSetters/pull/1)
for more information.
