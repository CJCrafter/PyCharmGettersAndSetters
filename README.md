## How to Generate Properties

2. A popup titled *"Generate"* will appear.
3. From the options available, select *"Getters and Setters"*.

## Customizing the Format

If the default format isn't quite right for you, don't worry. Customize the [live code template](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-live-templates.html) to tailor it to your needs. Need guidance? Refer to [this discussion](https://github.com/CJCrafter/PythonGettersAndSetters/pull/1) on customizing the template.
